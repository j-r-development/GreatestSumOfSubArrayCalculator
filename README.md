# GreatestSumOfSubArrayCalculator
			 * Coded by Jordan Rackley, at github at https://github.com/j-r-development/. Website at http://jordanrackley.dx.am/. 
			 * This is a simple console app that calculates the subarray with the largest sum. This app supports only integers, and arrays of any size.
			 * This app includes 2 initial modes. The first shows the algorithm working on a variety of sample inputs.
			 * The second takes in and validates user input, turns it into a manipulatable data structure of ints (list) and then runs the algorithm.
